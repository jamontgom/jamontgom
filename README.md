### I Will Turn Your Money Green

When I was in Missouri would not let me be
When I was in Missouri would not let me be
Wouldn't rest content till I came to Tennessee

If you follow me baby, I'll turn your money green
If you follow me baby, I'll turn your money green
I show you more money Rockefeller ever seen

If the river was whiskey baby and I was a duck
River was whiskey baby and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom, Lord, and I'd never come up

Lord, woman I hate, I see her every day
Woman I hate, I see her every day
But the woman I love she's so far 'way

Talk about sweetheart, I declare I'm a honest man
Talk about sweetheart, I declare I'm a honest man
Give my woman so many dollars it broke her apron string

All she give me was trouble, I'm troubled all the time
All she give me was trouble, I'm troubled all the time
I been troubled so long trouble don't worry my mind

I been down so long, it seem like up to me
I been down so long, it seem like up to me
Woman I love, she done quit, poor me

What's the need of me hollering
What's the need of me crying
Woman I love, she don't pay me no mind
